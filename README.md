# Vision-based-Grasping-of-Objects-using-Symmetry

## 1. Introduction/Abstract
The "Grasping Assuming Symmetry" project leverages the nature of symmetry in many objects. Our approach uses a depth camera to capture real-time 3D representations of the environment, focusing on object symmetries to optimize grasping points. This integration of depth-sensing technology and algorithmic innovation offers a promising advancement in robotic manipulation, ensuring more stable and efficient interactions with many objects in real-world scenarios.
